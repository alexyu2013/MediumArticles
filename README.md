# Python Notebook Tutorial Series: Complementing Medium Articles

Welcome to our Python Notebook Tutorial Series, designed to complement and expand upon various programming concepts introduced in Medium tutorials. Our aim is to provide you with hands-on experience and deeper insights into practical applications of advanced programming techniques.

## Tutorial 1: Dynamic React Agents with dynamic Top_k function

This first notebook in the series focuses on the integration of React agents with a dynamic top _k function, based on "Llama Index Framework". It demonstrates how to enhance selection processes, making them more efficient and adaptable to dynamic conditions. This tutorial serves as a practical extension to the theoretical concepts discussed in the corresponding Medium article.

### What You Will Learn

- **Introduction to React Agents and the Llama Index Framework**: Gain an understanding of React agents, their significance in Python, and how they integrate within the Llama Index Framework for dynamic data handling.
- **Dynamic Top _k Function**: Dive into the top _k function's role in data selection and processing, and why it's crucial for optimizing performance in various applications.
- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Follow a detailed guide on implementing React agents with a dynamic top _k function within your projects.


Each section is crafted to build upon the concepts introduced in the Medium article, providing you with a comprehensive understanding and the ability to implement these ideas in your own projects. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with a powerful toolset for data selection and processing tasks.

Stay tuned for more tutorials in this series, where we'll continue to explore and apply advanced programming concepts in practical, real-world scenarios.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into this notebook, make sure you have a basic understanding of Python and React. Familiarity with data processing concepts will also be helpful.
